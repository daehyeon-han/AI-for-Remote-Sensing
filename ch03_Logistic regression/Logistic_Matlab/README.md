# Logistic-Regression
In this project, I built a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.
The model predicts whether the student gets admitted based on his results on two exams.
I trained the model using historical data from previous applicants.
For each training example, we have the applicantâ€™s scores on two exams and the admissions decision.
